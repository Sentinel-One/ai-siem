# Validation Rules

Run this checklist before outputting any workflow JSON.

---

## Structural rules

- [ ] Top-level keys are exactly: `"name"`, `"description"`, `"actions"`
- [ ] Every action has: `"action"`, `"export_id"`, `"connected_to"`, `"parent_action"`
- [ ] `export_id` values are unique integers across all actions in the workflow
- [ ] No two actions share the same `export_id`
- [ ] Every `target` in `connected_to` references a valid `export_id` in the workflow
- [ ] Every `parent_action` (when non-null) references a valid loop `export_id`

## Action type rules

- [ ] `"type"` matches `"action_type"` in the data object
- [ ] `"tag"` is `"core_action"` for built-in actions, `"integration"` for integration-backed
- [ ] `"state"` is `"active"` (not `"draft"` or `"inactive"`)
- [ ] `"snippet_workflow_id"` and `"snippet_version_id"` are `null` unless action is a snippet referencing another workflow

## Trigger rules

- [ ] Exactly one trigger action per workflow (first in execution order)
- [ ] Trigger has `"parent_action": null`
- [ ] Trigger's `connected_to` points to the first action in the flow
- [ ] `singularity_response_trigger`: `filter_groups` is a non-empty array
- [ ] `singularity_response_trigger`: each filter_group has `event_type`, `event_subtypes`, `condition`, `is_disabled`, `run_automatically`
- [ ] `manual_trigger`: `trigger_type` is `"static"` or `"dynamic"`; if dynamic, `dynamic_properties` is a non-empty object

## Loop rules

- [ ] Loop connects to its first inner action using `"custom_handle": "inner"`
- [ ] All actions inside the loop have `"parent_action": <loop_export_id>`
- [ ] Actions outside the loop have `"parent_action": null`
- [ ] `break_loop` actions inside a loop have `"connected_to": []`
- [ ] `loop_type: "dynamic"` always has a non-null `object_to_iterate`
- [ ] `loop_type: "while"` or `"fixed"` has `object_to_iterate: null`
- [ ] In a `while` loop, the terminating condition has ONLY a `"true"` → `break_loop` edge. Do NOT
  add a `"false"` back-edge to an earlier inner action — the loop re-runs the inner block on its
  own, and a manual back-edge makes import fail with `422 "Invalid workflow data"`.

## Condition rules

- [ ] Condition uses either `"condition_type": "simple"` (with nested `condition` object) or `"condition_type": "multi"` (with flat `conditions` array) — not both
- [ ] For `"simple"`: `"condition"` is non-null, `"conditions"` is `null`
- [ ] For `"multi"`: `"conditions"` is a non-empty array, `"condition"` is `null`
- [ ] Condition branches use `"custom_handle": "true"` and `"custom_handle": "false"`
- [ ] A condition with only one branch (e.g., only `"true"`) is valid — the other is simply absent from `connected_to`
- [ ] **Approval / human-in-the-loop gates FAIL CLOSED.** A condition that guards a destructive action
  (block, isolate, disable) must test for the explicit approval value, e.g.
  `{{wait-for-slack.body.actions[0].value}} equals "approved"` — NEVER `not_equals "dismissed"`. On a
  Slack (or any `wait_for_interaction`) timeout the value resolves to empty, and empty is
  `!= "dismissed"`, so a fail-open `not_equals` gate would auto-run the destructive action with no
  approval. Route the destructive action off the `"true"` branch of an `equals` test only.

## Import / `parent_action` rules

- [ ] **`parent_action` is for LOOP membership ONLY** — it is `null` on every node that is not inside a
  loop; flow order is expressed **strictly** via `connected_to.target`, never via `parent_action`.
  Setting `parent_action` to a previous (non-loop) node's `export_id` is the #1 cause of an import
  `422 "Invalid workflow data"` even when every field otherwise looks correct.
- [ ] `export_id` values are arbitrary unique integers — they need not be sequential or positional (a
  real export uses ids like `9, 8, 5, 6`).
- [ ] `variable` action `data` carries its full field set: `variables_scope`, `expire_*`, `global_var_*`
  (in addition to the `variables` array).
- [ ] `manual_trigger` action `data` carries `trigger_type`, `dynamic_properties`, and `static_payload`.
- [ ] Fastest way to debug a persistent `422`: round-trip a live `export?ids=all` workflow member (which
  is guaranteed valid), then bisect — swap your nodes into the known-good envelope one at a time until
  the import breaks.

## Variable rules

- [ ] Each variable in `variables` array has `"name"`, `"value"`, `"is_secret"`
- [ ] Empty array initialization: value is `"[]"` (two brackets, no spaces)
- [ ] `variables_scope` is `"local"` or `"global"`
- [ ] Dynamic references use `{{...}}` double curly braces
- [ ] **HARD RULE**: if a variable's value contains `{{local_var.*}}`, that variable must be in
  its own dedicated Variable action — a single action must never define a variable whose value
  references another `local_var` set in the same action's `variables` array. Variables in one
  action are evaluated simultaneously, not sequentially, so forward/same-action references
  silently resolve to empty.

  ❌ Wrong — `fullPath` will be empty because `baseUrl` is resolved in the same pass:
  ```json
  { "variables": [
      { "name": "baseUrl",  "value": "https://api.example.com" },
      { "name": "fullPath", "value": "{{local_var.baseUrl}}/v1/alerts" }
  ]}
  ```
  ✅ Right — split into two sequential Variable actions:
  ```json
  // Action 1
  { "variables": [{ "name": "baseUrl",  "value": "https://api.example.com" }] }
  // Action 2 (connected after Action 1)
  { "variables": [{ "name": "fullPath", "value": "{{local_var.baseUrl}}/v1/alerts" }] }
  ```

## Integration rules

- [ ] Integration-backed actions have `"tag": "integration"`
- [ ] For import-ready JSON: `connection_id: null`, `connection_name: ""`, `integration_id: null`
- [ ] Integration URLs use `{{Connection.protocol}}{{Connection.url}}/path`
- [ ] **WARN THE USER** which integrations need to be pre-configured in the console

## Function syntax rules

- [ ] All functions use `{{Function.FUNCTION_NAME(args)}}` — capital F, capital function name
- [ ] Nested functions are valid: `{{Function.STRING(Function.MUL(42, Function.DATETIME_TO_MS(Function.DATETIME_NOW())))}}`
- [ ] JQ filter strings with double quotes inside must be escaped: `\"`
- [ ] `Function.COMPRESS` requires its files array in square brackets: `[local_var.myFile]`
- [ ] `Function.BASE64_DECODE_AS_BYTES` is used (not `BASE64_DECODE`) for COMPRESS input

## Common mistakes to avoid

- ❌ Defining multiple variables that reference each other in a single Variable action — they
  resolve simultaneously, so the reference will be empty. Split them into separate actions.
  ✅ One Variable action per variable whenever `{{local_var.*}}` appears in the value.
- ❌ Using `{{loop.item}}` inside a loop — use the action's slug: `{{loop-action-name.item}}`
  ✅ e.g., `{{loop-the-list-of-ipv4.item}}` for a loop named "Loop the list of IPv4"
- ❌ Referencing an action by its `export_id` — always use the slugified `name` field
- ❌ Setting `parent_action` on actions that are outside the loop
- ❌ Using `"custom_handle": "inner"` for anything other than the loop's first inner action
- ❌ Forgetting that action slug = name lowercased, spaces→hyphens, special chars dropped
- ❌ Setting `break_loop` with `connected_to` entries — it must always be `[]`
- ❌ Having a Singularity Response Trigger with empty `filter_groups` array
- ❌ Generating `connection_id` UUIDs — always use `null` for import-ready JSON
- ❌ Using `Function.JQ` with complex expressions directly — store in Variable first
- ❌ Mixing `condition` and `conditions` in the same condition action data object
- ❌ `send_email` attachments with `name`/`content` keys — the importer requires `file_name` and
  `file_content` (import `422 "Field required"` otherwise). `file_content` is base64.
- ❌ Wiring a `while`-loop condition's `false` branch back into the loop body — omit it (see Loop rules)
